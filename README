Samples from each experiment were sequenced on different sequencing runs.


For each experiment qiime2 was used to generate feature table, taxonomy files, and diversity files.
q2 output was then exported and imported into R for data visualization. R was also used for differential abundance testing with the ALDEx2 package.

For qiime 2 the general workflow was as follows:
1) import sequences
2) create table using dada2
3) create taxonomy using ggBLAST # found ggBLAST and vsearch classifiers worked the best
4) filter table using taxonomy # filter out unclassified, mitochondria, chloroplast; sampples > 2
5) create rarefaction plot using filtered table
6) create rarefied table and core metric artifacts
